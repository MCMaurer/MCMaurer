### Howdy ðŸ¤ 

My name is Michael, I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/) at the University of Arizona. I'm currently working on developing R lessons for ecologists, helping Carpentries community members produce new lessons in the [Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator) and [Carpentries Lab](https://github.com/carpentries-lab), and doing my best to learn Docker.
