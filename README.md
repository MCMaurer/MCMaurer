### Howdy ðŸ¤ 

My name is Michael, I'm an ecologist, data scientist, and educator. I'm currently a senior data scientist in the Transit Information Department at [Metro Transit](https://www.metrotransit.org/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/) at the University of Arizona, developing computational and data science curricula for researchers. My PhD was insect ecology at UC Davis, where I looked at the behavioral interactions of insect pests and their natural enemies.
